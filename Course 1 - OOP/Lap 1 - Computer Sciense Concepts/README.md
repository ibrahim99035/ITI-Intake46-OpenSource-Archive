# OOP Lab 1: Computer Science Concepts

This directory contains four C++ programs covering basic computer science concepts and ASCII operations.

---

## **Task 1: Arithmetic Operations**

**File:** `Task-1-ArthemeticOperations.cpp`
Performs basic arithmetic operations between two integers entered by the user.
Includes:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Division (with zero division check)
* Multiplication
* Modulus

---

## **Task 2: Character to Integer Conversion**

**File:** `Task-2-Character-to-Integer.cpp`
Converts an alphabetic character to its ASCII integer equivalent.

* Accepts only alphabetic characters (A–Z, a–z).
* Displays an error message if a number or invalid input is entered.

---

## **Task 3: Integer to Character Conversion**

**File:** `Task-3-Integer-to-Character.cpp`
Converts an integer value to its corresponding ASCII character.

* Accepts integer inputs.
* Outputs the character equivalent.

---

## **Task 4: Uppercase ↔ Lowercase Converter**

**File:** `Task-4-Uppercase-Lowercase.cpp`
Converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa using ASCII manipulation.

* Detects if the entered character is uppercase or lowercase.
* Outputs the corresponding converted character.

---

## **Usage**

Each program runs independently.
Compile using:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
./filename
```

Each program runs for **5 input rounds** as instructed in the console.
